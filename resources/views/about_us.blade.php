    <p align="justify">
        PakBlood is an initiative of AA’LA Solutions with an aim to connect blood donors with blood seekers. This online
        platform came into existence after the philanthropist Mr. Aamir Mahmood found out that thousands of Pakistanis
        die annually due to the blood loss. People run in search of compatible blood group while their loved ones
        breathe their last. <b>Local blood banks</b> go empty and deliveries are just a minute late to save precious
        lives. But
        not anymore! Become a part of this heroic scheme and be the change the world needs!
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        We know death is inevitable, but your contribution can bring a ray of hope, and together we may be able to help
        those in need. So, if you’re <b>eligible for donating blood</b>, don’t waste time thinking. After all, every
        second
        counts to save a life.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        Our non-profit organization keeps a complete record of blood donors for emergency cases. Moreover, our
        user-friendly site allows the needy to get in touch with the potential donors. With our efficient services, we
        make sure the recipients acquire blood in no time.
